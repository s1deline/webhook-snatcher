# Webhook Snatcher v3

this is the 3rd edition of our webhook snatcher, used for literally what the name says.

if you wanna set this up, make sure the game uses the **mtk kit**, cause if not this will not work. most fangames use the mtk kit tho. <br />

to use this in a game, you either need dev access or gotta submit a tower ingame. if you have dev access, try to make it not obvious and hide the script. you should also name it something like `" "` so it isn't searchable. do this so it's harder for the devs to find it and it lasts longer. <br />

the webhook should look like this:

<img 
  width="597" 
  height="398" 
  alt="image"

/>
